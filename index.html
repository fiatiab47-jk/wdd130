        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Albert Fiati" width="200">
        <p>Hello! I am Albert Fiati, out of the sixteen regions in Ghana,
            I am from the Volta Region. Anloga to be precise. Let me use this opportunity
            to tell you a little about my hometown. The Hogbetsotso festival is a vibrant
            annual celebration held by the Anlo Ewe people in the Anloga city, the traditional
            capital of the Anlo State in Ghana's Volta Region. Celebrated during the first week of November,
            the festival commemorates the historic exodus from Notsie in the present-day Togo, where
            the Anlo people escaped the tyranny of King Agorkoli.</p>
        <p>The town is renowned for its rich culture heritage, vibrant festivals like the Hogbetsotso as I mentioned
            earlier.
            Economically, Anloga thrives on fishing, farming, and small-scale trade, with growing interest in ec-tourism
            thanks to its natural beauty and cultural significance. Visitors can explore the scenic lagoon, enjoy fresh
            seafood and experience authentic Ewe traditions. Its role as a cultural hub makes Anloga a unique
            destination for anyone seeking history, nature, and vibrant community life.

        <p>Ghana is a vibrant country in West Africa, known for its rich history,cultural diversity, and warm
            hospitality. It was the first sub-Saharan African nation to gain independence in 1957. Ghana's landscape
            ranges from coastal beaches to lush forests and savannas, and its economy is driven by agriculture, gold,
            and cocoa
            exports.The capital city is Accra, and English is the official language.
