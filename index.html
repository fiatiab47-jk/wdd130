        <p>Hello! I am Albert Fiati, out of the sixteen regions in Ghana,
            I am from the Volta Region. Anloga to be precise. Let me use this opportunity
            to tell you a little about my hometown. The Hogbetsotso festival is a vibrant
            annual celebration held by the Anlo Ewe people in the Anloga city, the traditional
            capital of the Anlo State in Ghana's Volta Region. Celebrated during the first week of November,
            the festival commememorates the historic exodus form Notsie in the present-day Togo, where
            the Anlo people escaped the tyrannical of King Agorkoli. I hope to tell you more about myself on my next
            homepage.</p>
